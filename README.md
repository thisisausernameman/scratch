Brief Explanation of the code: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DK8FKvY4pKo_Y647i1LLnEwr2wpf-HKs9oJIQCmw-x4/edit

I wanted to see what I can create in scratch, but the creativity that i think of might be bit too hard to acutlly make since i'm still new to coding.
So I decided to make a small game where you essentially need to dodge enemies, the main goal is to just survive as long as you can, the longer you survive
the harder the game gets.
